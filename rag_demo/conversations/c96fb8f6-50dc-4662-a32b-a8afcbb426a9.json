      "content": "UiPath IXP eliminates the need for complex prompt engineering and upfront training through its inference-first training process.  Instead of requiring extensive pre-training with manually annotated documents, IXP allows agents to simply provide instructions (similar to a prompt) on what to extract and how it appears in the document.  The system then uses its built-in capabilities and post/pre-processing to ensure consistent data output, even with complex unstructured documents.  The ability to define \"field groups\" specifying the exact information needed further streamlines the process, providing the structured output directly without the need for extensive prompt engineering or prior training.",
